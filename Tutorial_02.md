## Exporting GIS Layers to AutoCAD

*Tutorial created by Jonathan Izen (jai2125@columbia.edu)*

This tutorial will guide you through the process of exporting GIS shapefiles for use as vector files in AutoCAD or Rhino.

1) Create a map with the layers that you want to export.

2) Right-click on one of the layers that you want to export to CAD, and choose `Data`, `Export to CAD`.

3) Choose from the drop-down menu named `Input Features` all the layers that you want to export.

You may choose DGW_R2004 as file type, just in case the computer you are going to open the files on doesnâ€™t have the latest version of CAD. Also, remember to always choose a destination location; otherwise GIS will choose a path for you and it will become difficult to locate your files.

4) GIS will automatically load the CAD layer you just exported into your map. You can remove the layer from here if you want to, and you can open your new layer in AutoCAD.
