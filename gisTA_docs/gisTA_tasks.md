## Tasks for the GIS TA

### Overview
Your responsibilities includes the management of data on the X drive, including acquisition of new data and the maintenance and documentation of existing data, as well as providing assistance to GSAPP students and faculty in finding and using GIS data and software.

The position requires a strong familiarity with the GIS data and GIS software. You are not expected to be an expert, but you should be able to assist with the most common tasks performed in GIS at GSAPP as well as be able to find and provide references for tasks and functions you are less-familiar with.

The workload for the position varies throughout the semester, and you will have to find a balance between the short-term and long-term tasks. Typically, the beginning of the semester has a heavier workload, including workshops and studio data requests from professors. Following midterms, most students have completed their analytical work, so the need for GIS help diminishes.

### Data to download and update (on to the X drive)
* [Bytes of the Big Apple](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page)
  * Download all datasets to upload onto the X Drive
  * [PLUTO Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) (download all PLUTO and MapPLUTO data yearly)
* Other datasets
	* https://data.cityofnewyork.us/widgets/dpc8-z3jc
	* http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/initiatives/3d-building.page
	* https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/NYC-Planimetrics/wt4d-p43d
* Specific data based on projects and accompanying studios.
* Organize data by geography on the X drive.
* Add data to master Excel File on the X drive.

### Specific GIS workshops for studios
* Pending request from faculty for specific studio workshops
* Request desired focus or intention with spatial data or mappings in the studio

### Write and update GIS tutorials
* Create text documents (.md) of tutorials as a text document
* Create a folder for images and key images within master folder
* Include description before tutorials explaining what the tutorial will accomplish.
* Include key image and description to be used on C4SR website
* Push to Github [tutorial repository](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/gis_tutorials) and create entry in C4SR site

### GIS Workshops (Beginning of Each Semester)
* Directly email specific faculty members announcing GIS Workshops (MArch, UD, HP)
* Reserve and book room in 202 Fayerweather for GIS Workshops (email Stephanie Cha-Ramos sc3600@columbia.edu)
* Create workshop poster to use in emails, social media, and post in designated boards in Avery Hall and Fayerweather
* Email Danielle Smoller (ds89@columbia.edu) to send out email to all students and faculty the first week of classes
* Download data and prepare presentation in computer lab prior to workshops

Hi [Dean],

The Center for Spatial Research will provide both GIS workshops and data services for the [fall or spring] semester. In addition, we want to know if architecture, historic preservation, or urban design professors need specific data or assistance with GIS.

Could you please send out the following email with the included attachment? The email should be sent via the listserv to include all AAD, ARCH, HP, and UD students.

Thank you!

Best,
[GIS TA]

GIS WORKSHOPS, DATA, & TUTORIALS

The Center for Spatial Research will be providing workshops in the beginning of the spring semester to give students an introduction to GIS and show them how to use some of the geographic data on the server.

We will be offering workshops for Architecture, Historic Preservation, and Urban Design students at the beginning of the semester. These workshops provide a basic familiarity in working with GIS data, including mapping data in the ArcGIS software suite and exporting data for use in the CAD and 3D software packages installed on all GSAPP workstations. All workshops are located in Fayerweather 202.

GIS FOR DESIGNERS: 2D BASICS
[day(s), date(s), and time(s)]

Some topics will include how to find and open data from the data archive, locate data not in the archive, visualize data in GIS, export data to CAD and Illustrator.

GIS FOR DESIGNERS: 3D TECHNIQUES
[day(s), date(s), and time(s)]

Some topics will include creating surfaces from point data, automatically extruding building footprints, creating elevation data and understanding elevation data types, and exporting any 3D data into other modeling software (such as Rhino, Illustrator, and 3dsMax).

GIS DATA

Please let us know if there is a specific area in which your studio may need base data - as the Center for Spatial Research collects data from all over the world, Hong Kong to Johannesburg, so we may have data your studio needs for the semester.

GIS TUTORIALS

The GIS Tutorials have been updated this semester and can be found on the Center's website. We have added several advanced tutorials that integrate Grasshopper plugins, Google Earth, and Google Maps to help visualize spatial data. http://c4sr.columbia.edu/tutorials

Questions can be directed to [GIS TA], ([your email]), the GIS student coordinator.
