## Exporting 3D Data and Importing in Rhino and 3DS Max

Below are intructions on how to import 3D data from ArcScene into Rhino and 3DS Max

Once you have your buildings extruded and at the right base heights, remove the topography layer (right-click on it and say “Remove”), and go to File > Export Scene > 3D. Save your file (the only option is VRML format). Depending on how big your file is, this might take some time.

Once you have done this open Rhino and import the file you just saved. You need to change the type of file to VRML in order to see this file. Once you import it you will notice that the file is all one mesh and that it has been rotated 90 degrees. You can rotate it back to its normal position and delete the camera that comes with it. Although the buildings don’t look fine under rendered or shaded view, they will render perfectly, and if you want to modify the buildings in any way you can always explode the mesh and convert it to NURBS using the MeshToNURBS command. However, you have to be careful with this because if you have too many buildings you might crash your computer. Another method is to export a building footprint layer from GIS to CAD, and then in Rhino, change the base heights and extrude the buildings using the mesh as a “snapping” reference. However, you will have to do this for every single building. The advantage is that you will have a site model that is super clean and built only with polysurfaces.
