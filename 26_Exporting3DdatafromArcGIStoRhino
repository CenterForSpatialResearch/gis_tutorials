#Exporting 3D Data from ArcGIS to Rhino 

##Visualizing 3D Data in ArcScene

Make a 3D file in ArcScene using this [tutorial](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/gis_tutorials/blob/master/05_Visualizing_Data_in_3D_Using_ArcScene.md).

#Exporting Data 

Enable the 'Data Interoperability' and '3D Analyst' extensions by going to 'Customize --> Extensions' in the toolbar of either ArcCatalog or ArcScene. Failure to do so will result in the necessary tools not running

Go to the 'layer 3D to Feature Class tool' in 'Arctoolbox --> 3D Analyst tools --> Conversion'
This tells arcscene that the layer is a mesh object that can be transformed to other relevant file types. Selecting the 'folder' button to the right of the 'Output Feature Class' address bar lets you change the destination and name of the output file

Select 'Quick Export' from 'Arctoolbox --> Data Interoperability tools'. Click the 'null' export type and change it to Autodesk 3ds. Select the folder in which to save the file.

#Importing to Rhino
'Import' the file into Rhino. You can edit the Rhino import settings if you wish, or you can just leave it default.

You'll notice that the faces of the objects imported from ArcScene render incorrectly so to fix that, you need to 'select all' and 'explode' the meshes. Now, all faces should be rendered properly on all sides.

#Importing with Z axis intact 
If the ArcScene layers have X, Y and Z axes, i.e. floating on a contour surface or particular z axis heights, you can still import them to Rhino at those heights. Refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/gis_tutorials/blob/master/09_Creating_A_3D_Site_Model_In_GIS.md) for help with this. Select 'feature to 3D by attribute' from 'Arctoolbox --> 3D analyst tools'. 
![t26-9.png](https://github.com/tolaoniyangi/gis_tutorials/blob/master/Images/Tutorial_26/t26-9.png)

Select the 'height field' as the 'Z axis', which would be ground elevation in this case.

Afterwards, extrude to the heights of each feature.

After this, repeat the process of exporting 'layer 3D to feature class' and 'importing' to Rhino.


#Exporting contour lines for Rhino 
Select 'export to CAD' from 'Conversion Tools --> To CAD.' This tools let you export a layer or multiple layers to CAD, at which point you can then'import' to Rhino. The CAD file will already be 3D if its base heights were already set up in ArcScene.
